- ### Question: is require work in javascript internally?
- ###### Answer: Yes, the require function is a part of the Node.js runtime environment, which means it is not a standard feature of JavaScript itself. Node.js is a server-side JavaScript environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on your machine or server outside of a web browser.
- The require function uses the `CommonJS module` system to load and manage modules in your Node.js application. When you call require to load a module, Node.js searches for the specified module in your application's node_modules folder, as well as in any global or system-level module directories.

### Q: what is native equivalent for require in javascript?
###### A: In a web browser environment, there is no native equivalent to the require function in Node.js. Web browsers do not provide a built-in module loading system like Node.js does, so you cannot use require to load external modules in your client-side JavaScript code.
However, there are several ways to load external JavaScript files and libraries in a web browser environment. One common approach is to use the script tag in HTML to load external JavaScript files. For example, you can add the following line to your HTML file to load an external JavaScript file called script.js:
```<script src="script.js"></script>```
This will load the script.js file and execute its contents in the global scope of your web page.

Another approach is to use a JavaScript module loader library, such as RequireJS or SystemJS, which provide a similar functionality to require in Node.js but adapted for the web browser environment. These libraries allow you to define and load modules in separate files, and handle dependencies between them.

Finally, in modern web browsers, you can use the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) module syntax, which provides a native module loading system in JavaScript.
This syntax allows you to define and export modules using the export keyword, and import them into other modules using the import keyword.
However, this syntax requires support from the browser and is not yet universally supported.
