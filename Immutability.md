strings are Immutabile
```Javascript strings are immutable, they cannot be modified "in place" so you cannot modify a single character```
const s = 'hi';
const p = s;
`is time hi js naya location ke sath p banayega wo point in kar raha like array n object`
p[0] = 'u';
console.log(s, p)
s[0] = 'u';
 

arrays and object are not 

some array methods are destructive like push pop they modify original array,
and others are not for example slice, map, filter.
